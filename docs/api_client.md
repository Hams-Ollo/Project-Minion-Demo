# API Client Documentation

## Overview

The `api_client.py` file in the `src` directory contains the implementation of the API client used in Project Minion. This client is responsible for making requests to external APIs, particularly the Groq API for AI model interactions.

## Key Components

1. **API Client Class**: A class that encapsulates the logic for making API requests.
2. **Authentication**: Handles API key management and authentication with the Groq API.
3. **Request Methods**: Implements methods for different types of API requests (GET, POST, etc.).
4. **Error Handling**: Manages and logs any errors that occur during API interactions.

## Usage

To use the API client in your code:

1. Import the API client class:

   ```python
   from src.api_client import APIClient
   ```

2. Initialize the client with your API key:

   ```python
   client = APIClient(api_key=your_groq_api_key)
   ```

3. Make API requests using the client methods:

   ```python
   response = client.make_request(endpoint, method, data)
   ```

## Error Handling

The API client includes robust error handling to manage common issues such as:

- Network errors
- Authentication failures
- Rate limiting
- Invalid responses

All errors are logged using the project's logging system for easy debugging and monitoring.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement request retries with exponential backoff for improved reliability
2. Add support for asynchronous requests to improve performance in high-volume scenarios
3. Implement a caching system to reduce API calls for frequently requested data

## Security Considerations

- Always use environment variables or secure secret management systems to store API keys
- Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Use HTTPS for all API communications to ensure data privacy and integrity

For more information on the project architecture and how the API client fits into the overall system, please refer to the [Project Architecture Document](project-architecture-doc.md).
