# Development Guide for Project Minion

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**
   - Install Python 3.8 or higher
   - Install an IDE of your choice (we recommend PyCharm or VSCode)
   - Clone the Project Minion repository

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```
   streamlit run src/main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main application code
  - `main.py`: Entry point of the application
  - `api_client.py`: API client for external services
  - `app.py`: Streamlit app configuration
  - `develop.py`: Development utilities
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch**
   - Follow the [Git Branching Strategy](git-branching-strategy.md)
   - Name your branch according to the feature or fix you're working on

2. **Implement your changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Add appropriate error handling and logging

3. **Write tests**
   - Add unit tests for new functions in the `tests/` directory
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request

4. **Update documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation files in the `docs/` directory
   - Add inline comments for complex logic

5. **Submit a pull request**
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Await code review from maintainers

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function arguments and return values
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use comments to explain complex logic, but prefer self-explanatory code

## Testing

- Use pytest for writing and running tests
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components
- Write both unit tests and integration tests
- Use mock objects to isolate components during testing

## Logging

- Use the `logging` module for all logging
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Include relevant context in log messages

## Error Handling

- Use try-except blocks to handle expected exceptions
- Raise custom exceptions for application-specific errors
- Log all errors with appropriate context

## Performance Considerations

- Use asynchronous programming where appropriate (e.g., for I/O-bound operations)
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords) to the repository
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities

## Continuous Integration

- All pull requests trigger automated tests
- Code style checks are performed automatically
- Failed checks must be addressed before merging

For more detailed information on specific components, refer to:
- [API Client Documentation](api_client.md)
- [Project Architecture](project-architecture-doc.md)
- [LangGraph Integration Guide](project-echo-langraph-integration-guide-v2.md)

Happy coding!
